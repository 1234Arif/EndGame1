<h1> problem Statement:</h1> 
<h3> Basically here we have worked with two types of Problem. 
	<ul> 
		<li> BMR( Besal Meabolic Rate) Problem.. </li> 
		<li> BMI( Besal Metabolic index) Problem.. </li>
	</ul>
	Now a days most of the people are aware of healthy life-style… Most of the people go to the gym and work-out a lot.. But the problem is they don’t know how much they work out.. In which condition their body will work most.. What  is the limit of BMR as well as BMI.. Because our body tolerance depends on that.. The deficiency or excessiveness of BMR harms our body.. Our project is based on BMR and BMI..
