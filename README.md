Problem Statement: 
			
			Basically here we have worked with two types of Problem. 
•	BMR( Besal Meabolic Rate) Problem.. 
•	BMI( Besal Metabolic index) Problem.. 
Now a days most of the people are aware of healthy life-style… Most of the people go to the gym and work-out a lot.. But the problem is they don’t know how much they work out.. In which condition their body will work most.. What  is the limit of BMR as well as BMI.. Because our body tolerance depends on that.. The deficiency or excessiveness of BMR harms our body.. Our project is based on BMR and BMI..


Proposed solution:
			Basically we have used two type of calculator.. 
•	BMR measuring calculator.. 
•	BMI measuring calculator. 
Basically we have tried to give some information on those two topics.. Then We have given charts to show people the limits of BMR. 
So, it will help people in two ways.. 1st ly they will know about BMR and BMI of body and finally through the calculator they can measure their Body BMR and BMI. They can compare them to the chart and finally make diction what should they do.. 
Again Our aim is to give  health tips on any topic.. But this is in progress .. Its not yet done completely. May be after some time it can fulfil all the requirements and the queries of the people.

Instructions to run the project:

			1st ly there is a log in page.. It will show you three option.. Sign in with google, Sign in with email , sign in with phone-number. User can take any choice. 
	If he/she will go for the e mail address then they has to fill up  some text field with valid name password.. These things will be stored in firebase database and authentication will be done. If everything will be valid then it will redirect the user to the next page. 
	Similarly if we will log in with phone number then we need to write the valid country code as well as the valid phone number. It will send a 6 digit otp to the user. If its correct then it will redirect the user to the next page.

	In the main page.. There will be two types of calculator there. One is to calculate BMR and other for BMI . If every field is filled up with proper data then it will show the valid/ correct answer.
